To do list

measure voltage
-AC setting
-DC setting

frequency
-measure min and max
-if greater or equal than 0.5 diff then record time between max and min * 2 = period, f = 1/period.

integrate with console
-feq greater than 9600
-VT100 protocol, non changing field locations
-describe AC, DC, freq how it was recorded
-easy to read
-bargraphs for voltages being measured. Bar graph real-time monitored proportional lengths to voltages.
